III. Design
----------
Download and extract files from final project folder. Make sure all of the files
in the file list are in the same folder. Open Hangman.cpp. Run the program and 
have fun!

Prompt at beginning of program - 
    Hello and Welcome to "Hangman"!
    This is a hangman program where you can test your knowlege on words!
    First you will be asked to make a player profile by entering a player name.
    Then you are free to play the game to your hearts content. At the end 
    of each game you will be asked two questions. You will first be asked if 
    you want to play again. If you choose no, next you will be asked if a 
    new player would like to play. If there is a new player they will be able
    to create a player profile as well. Once everyone is finished with the 
    program, you can end the program by resonding "N" to the two prompts 
    at the end of the game.
    At the end of the program, all player stats will be printed.
    Have fun!
